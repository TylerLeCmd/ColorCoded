## Foddian Momento

Welcome to ColorCoded, the Foddian game all about getting to the top! Similar to Jump King, there's a smoking hot color orb waiting at the top!

This game was originally created and intended as a "FBLA Motivation" game, but I have since began development for ColorCoded as the stand-alone game I wanted to create before.

On the off chance I don't think a Foddian climbing game will work, this game will be majorly adapted to a rouge-like in order to keep my sanity.

(Unfortunately I had no diagrams or flow maps because I was sending it on the fly :(/ )
