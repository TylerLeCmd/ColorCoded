# ColorCoded
## Foddian Momento

Welcome to ColorCoded, the Foddian game all about getting to the top! Similar to Jump King, there's a smoking hot color orb waiting at the top!

This game was originally created and intended as a "FBLA Motivation" game, but I have since began development for ColorCoded as the stand-alone game I wanted to create before.

On the off chance I don't think a Foddian climbing game will work, this game will be majorly adapted to a rouge-like in order to keep my sanity.

(Unfortunately I had no diagrams or flow maps because I was sending it on the fly :< )



### To run this game, please use the link on the repository home page.
### If using an IDE to run this game, you will need the newest Processing IDE environment (3.0+), or both the "Live Server" and the "p5.vscode" extensions for Visual Studio Code.
#### Processing can be downloaded [here.](https://processing.org/download)
#### Look up "ritwickdey.LiveServer" and "samplavigne.p5-vscode" in VS Code Extensions for proper game rendering.
